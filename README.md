## Overview

places.pub provides live, [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) compatible JSON-LD data for places from the [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/) database.

An OSM `node` with any id is given an URL of the form `https://places.pub/osm/n{id}`. The JSON-LD representation of the node is available at that URL, as required by ActivityPub.

For example, the Biblioth√®que de la Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal, Canada, has the OSM id `4723279250`. The URL for the JSON-LD representation of this place is `https://places.pub/osm/n4723279250`.

## Process

The data import from OSM to places.pub uses a three-step process:

- **Extract**: The data is extracted from the [planet OSM](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) data dump.
- **Transform**: The data is transformed into a JSON-LD representation suitable for ActivityPub using the `makeplaces.py` script.
- **Load**: The data is loaded to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and served via [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

Serving static files from S3 via CloudFront is a cost-effective way to serve large amounts of data with low latency.
